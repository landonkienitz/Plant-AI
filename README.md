# Plant-AI
My repository for IT 254 project

Hardware used: Arduino Kit, Soil Moisture Sensor, Wires, Breadboard, Resistor, LCD, USB cable, Power Supply, Plant with Soil.

Software used: Arduino IDE, DHT Sensor Library, LiquidCrystal Library, Python.

This project will be using the Arduino to measure soil temperature and moisture in soil to give us the perfect enviroment for the plant. To measure the soil temp a DHT11 sensor will be used and inserted into the soil. For the moisture level a Soil Moisture Sensor will be used. The main goal for this project is to give the plant a perfect enviroment to flourish in best possible soil.
